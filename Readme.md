# Fongik Evo

## Description
Fongik Evo is a game project developed as part of a fifth-year master's program in software development. This project was created by Sacha and me under the name **Fongik Prod**.

### Jam Theme: "The World is Shrinking"

### Main Idea
You play as a colony of fungal spores in a Petri dish that must grow by consuming nutrients, bacteria, and competing spores. The larger you become, the smaller the available space, making movement and survival increasingly difficult.

**Inspirations:** *Agar.io* and *Spore*
